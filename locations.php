							Today’s marketing strategies are far more complicated than the ones of yesteryear. Before the emergence of the Internet and the concept of a “search engine,” the process of acquiring new business leads required an entirely different approach. That’s not to say that the competition is any more or less steep than it was back then. However, the methods have changed. Anyone can start a business online, and companies that don’t capitalize on the popularity of online tools tend to fall by the wayside. At Actual SEO Media, Inc., we’ve made it our job to study how the Internet affects marketing. Even more, we make it our mission to develop the best strategies for Houston SEO to take advantage of the customers’ reliance on search engines and social media. Then, we put those strategies to the test for our own marketing. If you are here on this page, that means that we’re doing something right. And the fact that we’ve successfully helped a large and ever-growing number of local business owners expand their businesses through the use of our search engine optimization services means that we can produce the same results for your business. But before we get started, we think that it’s important for you to know just what SEO can do for your business.
						</p>
						<h3 class="mt-4">A New Way To Market Your Business With Houston SEO</h3>
						<p>
							You must use all of the powerful Internet marketing tools to ensure customers discover your business. While marketing hasn’t changed much, it has moved to a new platform. This brings both new opportunities and challenges: You now have the opportunity to market your products and services effortlessly to customers across the globe; however, so does everyone else.
							Your potential customers’ attention spans are shorter than ever, but with online marketing, your future leads are actively searching for your services.
							Anyone can wind up on the first page of search engine results; however, earning and maintaining that rank usually requires expert search engine optimization.
							With Actual SEO Media, Inc., you’ll be able to position your company comfortably within the online marketplace. We’ll connect your business with future customers through the use of a thorough strategy known as SEO. With SEO, your business website will compete with others to earn the top spot on Google rankings. The higher your web page is ranked, the more web traffic you’ll receive daily. As the majority of people don’t look past the first page, it’s crucial that your website achieves as high a ranking as possible. Keep reading to learn how SEO directs customers to your website, then to your business. Afterward, we’ll explain how to select the best SEO firm for your marketing goals. You’ll be able to see in more detail how Actual SEO Media, Inc. is the best company to make the most out of your online marketing.
						</p>
						<h3 class="mt-4">New Challenges Require New Goals</h3>
						<p>
							Unfortunately, most people today don’t thoroughly understand the new advertising matrix. These well-intentioned Internet marketers invest much money in creating a website with fancy bells and whistles. That’s wonderful; however, having an epic website doesn’t help you if your customer is never directed to it. In other words, if your competitors show up at the top of SERPs and you do not, your bells and whistles – like that proverbial tree in the forest – make no noise at all because there is nobody to hear what it has to say. Our associates are wizards in  search engine optimization
							. Simply stated, this is the technology that makes your website rise to the top of the popular search engine results so that people looking for your product or service can find you right away. It is via the search engine that your customers look for you. At Actual SEO Media, Inc., we use our training and technology to keep you at the top of search engine lists. Our systems are designed and tested to find and deliver your customers directly to you at affordable prices. We make it easy for business owners to optimize their websites, no matter the size of their company or years in business.

						<h3 class="mt-4">Take Advantage of Social Media</h3>
						<p>
							Today, one person out of every nine uses Facebook – and that figure doesn’t even begin to express the number of shoppers who use any of the many other online social media sites. If your business doesn’t have an active and vital online presence on social media, then you are certainly missing the boat. In much the same way Houston SEO delivers customers to your virtual doorstep, we can also make sure your online or social media ‘storefront’ features prominently among the online shopping favorites of your customers. Because we work so diligently hard to stay ahead of the trends in Internet advertising, we can keep you positioned at the front of the pack where your competitors are concerned.

													You should expect your Houston SEO consultant to give you a detailed explanation of the strategies they use. They should leave you in no doubt about how they would drive up your website’s rankings on Google’s SERPs. They should give you a good estimate of the time it would take them to arrive at a positive outcome.
												</p>

												<p>
													Among the things you should ask for is a detailed technical review of your website. This will help to identify harmful elements affecting your website’s position, such as broken links and error pages. You should expect the professional to provide both on-page and off-page optimization.
												</p>

												<p>On-page optimization means making your website’s URL more search engine-friendly. Examples of this are improving the internal linking structure and optimizing the web page titles, meta tags, and headings. Off-page optimization means working on various link-building strategies, gaining authority, and improving the visibility of your site.

													It is very important to choose a marketing agency that will strictly abide by Google’s Webmaster Guidelines. They should follow the best practices not just on Google but also on Bing and Yahoo. They should avoid any unacceptable practices such as keyword stuffing, doorway pages, hidden text, paying for links, etc. Understand that Google is very strict about these things. If you want to be on Google’s SERPs, then you have to follow Google’s rules. Otherwise, you can very easily get banished from Google’s search engine. It is very important for your Houston SEO only to use white hat techniques.

													This is a trick question – no reasonable company can promise you that. No firm should say they would rank your website #1 on Google’s SERPs. At that point, you should just turn back and walk away.
												</p>
												<p>
													The reason is that nobody really knows about the secrets of Google. An online marketing professional professing to “game” Google is wrong and unethical. It is nothing more than a bogus claim which cannot and should not be trusted by anyone. Ranking number one cannot be guaranteed. A reputable specialist would follow the best Google practices to get you far ahead on Google’s SERPs.
