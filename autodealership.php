							<div class="text text-white">
								As a business owner, it’s easy to get frustrated with how your auto manufacturer handles advertising for your dealership. You might feel stifled if you’re forced into a co-op deal with approved vendors instead of working with someone else who can provide more successful marketing plans. Perhaps you think that you can still turn the tides in your favor with this type of restricted advertising, but we’re here to tell you the truth – you can do better, and we can show you how.

								The unfortunate reality is that a co-op’s “brand-compliant” ad restrictions only set you up to fail. Vendors often corner you into using outdated, highly ineffective marketing techniques that provide little to no return on investment. You may be prohibited from using particular language in your campaigns or have restrictions placed on your font and color choices for graphics. Worst of all, you’re throwing away thousands of dollars for this mediocre “solution.”

								For years, car dealers have used marketing techniques such as billboards, ads on television, radio ads, and other print ads. This was an excellent method for decades. However, in the age of technology, more and more consumers are turning away from those types of ads and obvious signboards, and your competitors are taking notice. More and more companies, including vehicle manufacturers, are following where the audience is going, and the audience is spending a significant amount of time on the Internet. Naturally, brands are going to start marketing on the Internet.

							<h2>Uplift Your Car Dealership</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="text">
							The manufacturers, however, want to stay in control of how their product is being advertised. Therefore, they are going to rely on the car dealers they are partnering with. But manufacturers do not stop there. They will want to find a way to turn a profit. Thus, they create this co-op deal that may sound amazing, but it mainly helps the manufacturer more than the dealership, and the car dealers get the short end of the stick. By creating all these strict rules and only offering a small pool of marketing vendors, the manufacturers come out on top while the dealerships are left trying to keep their heads above water.
Not only are your resources going down the drain, but another aspect threatens to doom your business into becoming just another face in the crowd. Co-op vendors often provide premade graphics and promos for your ad campaigns, which may sound like a benefit at first. Unfortunately, this means that other car dealers are using the exact same resources, which makes it harder for customers to differentiate local businesses. To the average consumer, your brand identity becomes almost a carbon copy of your rival’s in the next town over, with the same graphics, ad copy, and, in some cases, even prices.

By following the rigid guidelines imposed on your advertising methods, your dealership risks fading into obscurity. Your online presence is obscured by an indistinguishable identity, joining a long list of cookie-cutter sites that all parrot the same information. You want your business to stand out from the crowd as a prominent automotive dealer that outshines competitors, but how can you get the exposure you need without violating any brand restrictions? The answer is quite simple: hire a professional team of search engine optimization experts. SEO consultants like Actual SEO Media, Inc. have experience working with clients who need to create compelling web content and ad copy that complies with brand guidelines. We’ve worked with new and used car dealerships, producing effective digital marketing strategies that adhere to the limitations imposed by major brands like Ford, Kia, and Dodge. As a Houston-based SEO company, you could say that this isn’t our first rodeo.

						<div class="info-box p-0">
							<div class="text text-white">
								Although co-op advertising materials would have you believe otherwise, no two automotive dealerships are the same. What works for one dealer may not work for you, which is why Actual SEO Media, Inc. creates a custom advertising strategy for each client we work with. Whether you’re a dealership that exclusively sells new Nissan vehicles or a used car seller that focuses on Chrysler automobiles, we’ll put in the time and effort that you won’t get from co-op vendors to provide the best SEO solutions for you. By focusing on your dealership’s specialty and what makes you unique from other auto sellers, we can help you find the customers you’re looking for. For example, if you specialize in selling new Ford trucks, you’ll need to show up in search results that potential customers see on Google when they want to go truck shopping. One of the keywords that a user may type into the search engine could be “used Ford trucks near me.” They want to find local products from local sellers, so it’s crucial for your Google Business Profile, formally known as Google My Business, to appear on these SERPs and be in a good position. Likewise, if your niche market is used Subaru SUVs and you operate in Memphis, you’re certainly going to need to appear in results for searches like “affordable Subaru for sale Memphis.” Some of these keywords may be obvious, especially from a business owner’s standpoint, but some of them aren’t as easy to ascertain. That’s why Actual SEO Media, Inc. employs in-depth keyword research as part of its optimization efforts. This integral part of SEO allows us to zero in on customers who will most likely want to buy your cars. Instead of wasting time guessing what people are searching for, allow our team to research the best keywords by using the latest tools and software. Break free from your co-op’s control by letting Actual SEO Media, Inc. handle your dealership’s advertising needs. Give us a call or stop by our main Houston office. We’ll get you started on improving your dealership’s online presence.
